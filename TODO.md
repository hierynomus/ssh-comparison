* note whether its a library, stand-alone client/server, or both
* mention SSH v1 support (I guess not supporting it could be counted as a 
  feature these days... or at least it is important that one can disable it)
* In the comparison tables, display how many impls per proto / protos per implicit=false
  there are.

* Distinguish clients and servers in comparison; perhaps offer
  separate comparison pages for clients, servers, and combined...?
